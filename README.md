# React Starter-Pack

This is a baseline configuration for creating complex React sites with module dependencies

It uses:
* Webpack
* Sass
* Babel
* ESLint
* as well as a suite of cool tools: node, npm, yarn

This starterpack was built in Tim Tregubov's Web Development class (http://cs52.me/assignments/sa/starterpack/) and is live at http://shreyas-cs52-starterpack.surge.sh/.

## Usage

```
yarn start
```

Creates and runs the web app locally (localhost)

```
yarn deploy
```

Deploys the app to the surge URL specified in the `package.json` file

## Elements

### NPM, node, and yarn

**NPM** is the dependency package manager for Node.js and the javascript ecosystem in general. We use the package manager to install various javascript tools. 

**Node.js** is a javascript platform for running javascript outside of a browser for developing server side applications . You can do things like `npm install somepackage` and it will download that package and add it to your project. 

**Yarn** is a faster/better npm. It uses the same repository of packages. You can use it practically interchangeably - but don’t mix them, that can cause issues as they store files slightly differently.

### Webpack

**Webpack** is a build tool. What it does is take all your dependencies (all the various files and libraries that your project is using) and bundle them up together — but in a smart way where it will only bundle up the things you need. It can do any preprocessing that you need, such as converting various code syntax and supports hot-reloading, so you never have to refresh the page manually again. Most cleverly it actually analyzes your code and figures out what you are doing and only includes what is necessary. It makes 1 file out of all your JS files, it can optimize your images, it can make your CSS better.

Webpack is also used to run our app. We could start up a python webserver to load the files, but webpack comes with a dev server built in and it is much better.

### Babel

**Babel** is a transpiler that converts newer es6+ javascript syntax to more compatible es5 syntax that browsers actually understand (browsers are typically behind in their ECMAScript support).

### ESLint

**Linters** are code parsers that check your code for syntax errors, common style mistakes, and makes sure that your code is clean and follows some best practices. Linters help save time, detect bugs, and improve code quality. Linters exist for all types of languages and even markdown such as HTML, CSS, and JSON. Linters are especially helpful for detecting syntax errors while using dynamically typed languages in lightweight editors such as VSCode and Atom.

This is based on ESLint (for VSCode) with the Airbnb style guide.

### Sass

CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. **Sass** lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
